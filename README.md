Very simple program to count number of palindromes in randomized strings of ints and chars. Mainly used to compare loop efficiencies vs. Python. Both files are included to compare. Python version needs **numpy** and **matplotlib**, C++ version needs no speical requirements. 

C++ version also randomizes various license plate formats common in the US and checks for palindromes within. Input epoch, run, and string length values in command line for C++, otherwise leave blank to use default values.
