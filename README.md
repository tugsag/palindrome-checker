Very simple program to generate random strings of either characters or integers of given length and run an experiment to count how many palindromes on average there are. Created mainly to compare C++ performance against Python on large experiment sizes and loop efficiencies. Python requires **matplotlib** and **numpy**. C++ has no special requirements. 

For the **check.cpp** file, there is also a license plate simulator to check for palindromes in US license plates of the form "char char char int int int int".
