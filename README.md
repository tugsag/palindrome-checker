Very simple program to count number of palindromes in randomized strings of ints and chars. Mainly used to compare loop efficiencies vs. Python. All files are included to compare. C++, C#, Java versions need no special requirements, pure Python version (**check.py**) requires **matplotlib**, numpy optimized Python version (**numpy_check.py**) requires latest **numpy** version as well.

C++ version also randomizes various license plate formats common in the US and checks for palindromes within. Input epoch, run, and string length values in command line for C++, otherwise leave blank to use default values.
